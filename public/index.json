Current NLOS imaging methods offer a compromise between accuracy and reconstruction time as experimental setups have become more reliable, faster, and more accurate. However, all these imaging methods implement different assumptions and light transport models that are only valid under particular circumstances. This paper lays down the foundation for a cohesive theoretical framework which provides insights about the limitations and virtues of existing approaches in a rigorous mathematical manner. In particular, we adopt Dirac notation and concepts borrowed from quantum mechanics to define a set of simple equations that enable: i) the derivation of other NLOS imaging methods from such single equation (we provide examples of the three most used frameworks in NLOS imaging: back-propagation, phasor fields, and f-k migration); ii) the demonstration that the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction operator is the propagation operator for wave-based imaging methods; and iii) the demonstration that back-propagation and wave-based imaging formulations are equivalent since, as we show, propagation operators are unitary. We expect that our proposed framework will deepen our understanding of the NLOS field and expand its utility in practical cases by providing a cohesive intuition on how to image complex NLOS scenes independently of the underlying reconstruction method.\nDOI: 10.1364/OE.518466\n","date":"11 March 2024","permalink":"/publications/2024_cohesive_framework_for_non-line-of-sight_imaging_based_on_dirac_notation/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Cohesive framework for non-line-of-sight imaging based on Dirac notation"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/computational-imaging/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Computational Imaging"},{"content":"I am a Ph.D. candidate at Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain), working at the Graphics and Imaging lab.

It formulates the problem as a diffractive wave propagation, solved by the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld diffraction (RSD) integral. Efficient Phasor Fields implementations employ RSD-based kernels to propagate waves from parallel planes by means of 2D convolutions. However, the kernel storage requisites are prohibitive, hampering the integration of these techniques in memory-constrained devices and applications like car safety.Instead of relying on expensive RSD kernels, we propose the use of alternative virtual lenses to focus on the incoming phasor field and image hidden scenes. In particular, we propose using zone plates (ZP), which require significant less memory. As our results show, our ZP virtual lenses allow us to obtain reasonable reconstructions of the hidden scene, offering an attractive trade-off for memory-constrained devices.\nDOI: 10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10094929\n","date":"4 May 2023","permalink":"/publications/2023_zone_plates_for_phasor_fields/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Zone Plate Virtual Lenses for Memory-Constrained NLOS Imaging"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/zone-plates/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Zone Plates"},{"content":"Pablo Luesia-Lahoz, Miguel Crespo, Adrian Jarabo, and Albert Redo-Sanchez\nOptics Letters 47.15 (2022): 3796-3799.\nAbstract: #Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging aims to reconstruct partially or completely occluded scenes. Recent approaches have demonstrated high-quality reconstructions of complex scenes with arbitrary reflectance, occlusions, and significant multi-path effects. However, previous works focused on surface scattering only, which reduces the generality in more challenging scenarios such as scenes submerged in scattering media. In this work, we investigate current state-of-the-art NLOS imaging methods based on phasor fieldsto reconstruct scenes submerged in scattering media. We empirically analyze the capability of phasor fields in reconstructing complex synthetic scenes submerged in thick scattering media. We also apply the method to real scenes, showing that it performs similarly to recent diffuse optical tomography methods.\nDOI: 10.1364/OL.463296\n","date":"25 July 2022","permalink":"/publications/2022-nlos-presence-scattering-media/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Non-line-of-sight imaging in the presence of scattering media"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/scattering-media/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scattering Media"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/announcement/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Announcement"},{"content":"Welcome to my web page!!!\nI will be uploading content about my professional life.
