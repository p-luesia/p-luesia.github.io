[{"content":" Pablo Luesia-Lahoz Ph.D. candidate Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of prof. Adolfo Muñoz and prof. Diego Gutierrez at Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain), and member of the Graphics \u0026amp; Imaging Lab of the I3A Institute. Right now, my Ph.D. thesis focus on pushing the boundaries of transient imaging and looking around corners, on the topics of non-line-of-sight imaging and computer graphics. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s and Master\u0026rsquo;s degree in Computer Engineering both in Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain). Recently I finished a colaboration with prof. Andreas Velten at University of Wisconsin-Madison on the topic of NLOS imaging. Research topics # Computer graphics: Our research focus on the advance of computer generated graphics, and specifically, those oriented to transient imaging. I have participated in the creation of a library that pushes those limits. Transient imaging: The appear of ultra-fast sensors have allowed us to capture the propagation in the light decoupled by time. We search for new applications for this technology, and pursue new simulation ways to optimize the prototiping of approaches pipeline. NLOS imaging: Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging in the context of transient imaging can be used to loook around corners. Our research looks for new approaches to get better reconstructions in of time, memory, and/or quality. Most of our implementations are included in the y-tal library .

Current NLOS imaging methods offer a compromise between accuracy and reconstruction time as experimental setups have become more reliable, faster, and more accurate. However, all these imaging methods implement different assumptions and light transport models that are only valid under particular circumstances. This paper lays down the foundation for a cohesive theoretical framework which provides insights about the limitations and virtues of existing approaches in a rigorous mathematical manner. In particular, we adopt Dirac notation and concepts borrowed from quantum mechanics to define a set of simple equations that enable: i) the derivation of other NLOS imaging methods from such single equation (we provide examples of the three most used frameworks in NLOS imaging: back-propagation, phasor fields, and f-k migration); ii) the demonstration that the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction operator is the propagation operator for wave-based imaging methods; and iii) the demonstration that back-propagation and wave-based imaging formulations are equivalent since, as we show, propagation operators are unitary. We expect that our proposed framework will deepen our understanding of the NLOS field and expand its utility in practical cases by providing a cohesive intuition on how to image complex NLOS scenes independently of the underlying reconstruction method.\nDOI: 10.1364/OE.518466\n","date":"11 March 2024","permalink":"/publications/2024-cohesive-dirac-notation-for-nlos/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Cohesive framework for non-line-of-sight imaging based on Dirac notation"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/computational-imaging/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Computational Imaging"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/nlos/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Nlos"},{"content":" ","date":null,"permalink":"/publications/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Publications"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":" ","date":null,"permalink":"/dissemination/","section":"Dissemination","summary":"","title":"Dissemination"},{"content":"We attended again to the European Researchers\u0026rsquo; Night!!

It formulates the problem as a diffractive wave propagation, solved by the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld diffraction (RSD) integral. Efficient Phasor Fields implementations employ RSD-based kernels to propagate waves from parallel planes by means of 2D convolutions. However, the kernel storage requisites are prohibitive, hampering the integration of these techniques in memory-constrained devices and applications like car safety.Instead of relying on expensive RSD kernels, we propose the use of alternative virtual lenses to focus on the incoming phasor field and image hidden scenes. In particular, we propose using zone plates (ZP), which require significant less memory. As our results show, our ZP virtual lenses allow us to obtain reasonable reconstructions of the hidden scene, offering an attractive trade-off for memory-constrained devices.\nDOI: 10.1109/ICASSP49357.2023.10094929\n","date":"4 May 2023","permalink":"/publications/2023_zone_plates_for_phasor_fields/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Zone Plate Virtual Lenses for Memory-Constrained NLOS Imaging"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/zone-plates/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Zone Plates"},{"content":"The Graphics \u0026amp; Imaging Lab assisted to the Paraninfo building in Zaragoza (Spain) for the European Researchers\u0026rsquo; Night 2022.

Recent approaches have demonstrated high-quality reconstructions of complex scenes with arbitrary reflectance, occlusions, and significant multi-path effects. However, previous works focused on surface scattering only, which reduces the generality in more challenging scenarios such as scenes submerged in scattering media. In this work, we investigate current state-of-the-art NLOS imaging methods based on phasor fieldsto reconstruct scenes submerged in scattering media. We empirically analyze the capability of phasor fields in reconstructing complex synthetic scenes submerged in thick scattering media. We also apply the method to real scenes, showing that it performs similarly to recent diffuse optical tomography methods.\nDOI: 10.1364/OL.463296\n","date":"25 July 2022","permalink":"/publications/2022-nlos-presence-scattering-media/","section":"Publications","summary":"","title":"Non-line-of-sight imaging in the presence of scattering media using Phasor Fields"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/scattering-media/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scattering Media"},{"content":" This page is not updated.
