# Who I am

Hello! My name is Pablo Luesia-Lahoz from Zaragoza (Spain). I am a computer researcher interested in new advances in science in general, and thecnolgy. For that reason, I studied computation engineer in Universidad de Zaragoza, where I also got my master on the same topic.

Right now, I am a Ph.D. candidate at Universidad de Zaragoza, with the group [Graphics and Imaging lab](https://graphics.unizar.es/), under the supervision of [prof. Adolfo Muñoz](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~amunoz/) and [prof Diego Gutierrez](http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~diegog/).

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain), working at the Graphics and Imaging lab. My supervisors are prof. Adolfo Muñoz and prof. Diego Gutierrez, and together we work on computational imaging, specifically, Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging, transient imaging and computer generated graphics. I have a master's and bachelor degrees on computer engineering in Universidad de Zaragoza, and I have also worked with prof. Andreas Velten at University of Wisconsin-Madison on NLOS imaging.

# Hobbies

Obviously, since I am a computer engineer, I love playing videogames. But that is not all. I also like climbing and hiking in the mountains. This was partly because  Cooking is a need, but sometimes I like put a little more of effort to do it.
