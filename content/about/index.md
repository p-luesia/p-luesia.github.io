# Who I am

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain), working at the Graphics and Imaging lab. My supervisors are prof. Adolfo Mu√±oz and prof. Diego Gutierrez, and together we work on computational imaging, specifically, Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging, transient imaging and computer generated graphics. I have a master's and bachelor degrees on computer engineering in Universidad de Zaragoza, and I have also worked with prof. Andreas Velten at University of Wisconsin-Madison on NLOS imaging.

# Research experience

# Hobbies

Obviously, since I am a computer engineer, I love playing videogames. But that is not all. I also like climbing and hiking in the mountains. This was partly because  Cooking is a need, but sometimes I like put a little more of effort to do it.
