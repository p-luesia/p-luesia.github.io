We attended again to the European Researchers' Night!! 
This time, the Graphics & Imaging Lab assisted to the Caixa Forum buildning in Zaragoza (Spain) for the European Researchers' Night 2023.
We repeated the activity of past year, "Create your own virtual character" that people of all ages could enjoy, where we introduced people into virtual reality with some VR headsets, and we showed how the children could transform their drawings into moving characters. This year we also showed the composition of the light, and how they could build a simple camera with a box and a hole (a pinhole camera). And among all these activities, we had the oportunity to explain directly our work to people of all ages.
