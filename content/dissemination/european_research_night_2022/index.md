The Graphics & Imaging Lab assisted to the Paraninfo building in Zaragoza (Spain) for the European Researchers' Night 2022.
We prepared the activity "Create your own virtual character" that people of all ages could enjoy. We prepared Virtual Reality headsets to introduce everybody that wanted to into the virtual reality experience, and we showed how the children could transform their drawings into moving characters.

Then, we took the chance to explain what our work consisted to people of all ages.
