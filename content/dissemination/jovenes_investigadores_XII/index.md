We presented a poster of our work Zone Plate Virtual Lenses for Memory-Constrained NLOS Imaging for the XII edition of the "Jóvenes Investigadores e Investigadoras" from the I3A institute. This allowed researchers of different areas to show their work between them, and to different students and professors of Universidad de Zaragoza.
