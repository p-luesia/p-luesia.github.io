Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of [prof. Adolfo Mu√±oz](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~amunoz/) and [prof. Diego Gutierrez](http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~diegog/) at [Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain)](https://www.unizar.es/), and member of the [Graphics & Imaging Lab](https://graphics.unizar.es/) of the [I3A Institute](https://i3a.unizar.es/). Right now, my Ph.D. thesis focus on pushing the boundaries of transient imaging and looking around corners, on the topics of non-line-of-sight imaging and computer graphics. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Engineering both in Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain). Recently I finished a colaboration with [prof. Andreas Velten](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/staff/velten-andreas/) at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) on the topic of NLOS imaging.

## Research topics

- **Computer graphics**: Our research focus on the advance of computer generated graphics, and specifically, those oriented to transient imaging. I have participated in the creation of a library that pushes those limits.
- **Transient imaging**: The appear of ultra-fast sensors have allowed us to capture the propagation in the light decoupled by time. We search for new applications for this technology, and pursue new simulation ways to optimize the prototiping of approaches pipeline.
- **NLOS imaging**: Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging in the context of transient imaging can be used to loook around corners. Our research looks for new approaches to get better reconstructions in of time, memory, and/or quality. Most of our implementations are included in the y-tal library [{{< icon "github" >}}](https://github.com/diegoroyo/tal).
