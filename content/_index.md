I am a Ph.D. candidate at Universidad de Zaragoza (Spain), working at the Graphics and Imaging lab. My supervisors are prof. Adolfo Mu√±oz and prof. Diego Gutierrez, and together we work on computational imaging, specifically, Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging, transient imaging and computer generated graphics. I have a master's and bachelor degrees on computer engineering in Universidad de Zaragoza, and I have also worked with prof. Andreas Velten at University of Wisconsin-Madison on NLOS imaging.
